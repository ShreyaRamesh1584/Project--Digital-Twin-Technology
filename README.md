As part of an internship at a unicorn, I worked on a paper on Digital Twin Technology, it's scope at large and in the FMCG sector in particular. 
The paper included a detailed understanding of the technology, its current usage in the manufacturing sector and how it can be integrated into the FMCG sector. 
Within the FMCG sector, there were 5 major verticals that were covered in the paper, including:
1. 
2. 
3. 
4.
5.

To support its usage in Supply Chain and Logistics, as one such space where the technology holds benefits, a sales forecasting model was built, and its results were
included in the paper. It was used as an example to support a proposal to integrate machine learning into the model.

The working would include:
1. Model receiving real time data from the physical entity through sensors and actuators. 
2. This data would then be fed into the model, to forecast results.
3. The digital twin could then be used to change and tweak key parameters to understand its effect on key business parameters (5 of its use cases as mentioned above)
before implementing it in the physical model.
4. This would help save time and money spend in first building prototypes and then carrying out implementation. 

The project was part of R&D for an internation client at the firm. The research paper I worked on was presented on conclusion of my internship, to the team and partners
and is currently in pipeline.
