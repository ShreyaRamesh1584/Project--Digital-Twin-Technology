As part of my most recent internship at a unicorn, I worked on a paper on Digital Twin Technology, it's scope at large and in the FMCG sector in particular. 
The paper included a detailed understanding of the technology, its current usage in the manufacturing sector and how it can be integrated into the FMCG sector. 
Within the FMCG sector, there were 5 major verticals that were covered in the paper, including:

1. Smart Manufacturing

2. Product Design

3. Inventory Management 

4. Marketing

5. Logistics

To support its usage in Logistics, as one such space where the technology holds benefits, a sales forecasting model was built, and its results were
included in the paper. It was used as an example to support a proposal to integrate machine learning into the model.

The working would include:
1. Model receiving real time data from the physical entity through sensors and actuators. 
2. This data would then be fed into the model, to forecast results.
3. The digital twin could then be used to change and tweak key parameters to understand its effect on key business parameters (5 of its use cases as mentioned above)
before implementing it in the physical model.
4. This would help save time and money spent in first building prototypes and then carrying out implementation. 

The project was part of R&D for an international client of the firm. The research paper I worked on was presented upon conclusion of my internship, to the team and partners and is currently in the pipeline. 

Four models were trained and the R2 Score for all for were as follows:

1. Linear Regression : 76.25%
2. Random Forest Regression : 83.32%
3. Decision Tree Model : 79.98%
4. Support Vector Regression Model : 76.0069%

The R2 score is a measure of the variablity in data that the model can handle, therefore higher the R2 score the more accurate would be the predictions. Hence the
random forest regression model was chosen, and the same was mentioned in the paper. 
To better showcase the data a dashboard was also constructed. 

Since the data is hypothetical in this case, the code and dashboard only serve to showcase the potential of the technology if it were to be put to use. 

Attached below is a screenshot of the dashboard constructed, that can also be downloaded from the repository along with the notebook.
